# Paradise Discord Bot

Private automation bot built for the Paradise Discord server. It links member Steam accounts, watches for Steam activity, curates leaderboards and sales boards, adds moderation tooling, and mirrors GitHub activity into Discord ‚Äì all while persisting state in MySQL so it survives restarts.

## ‚ú® Highlights
- **Steam-aware announcements** ‚Äì achievements, game library additions/removals, ‚Äúnow playing‚Äù sessions, and running leaderboards all stay in sync with linked Steam accounts.
- **Persistent sales board** ‚Äì a single embed with button-based pagination that keeps the latest discounted Steam titles cached and refreshed on a schedule.
- **Discord-native utilities** ‚Äì slash commands for configuration, Steam linking, XP tracking, moderation, and link permits tailored to Paradise staff workflows.
- **Safety net moderation** ‚Äì automatic hate-speech filtering, link deletion unless a permit is active, and XP awards with level-up pings in the configured channel.
- **GitHub commit mirroring** ‚Äì poll or receive webhooks for repository updates, then post rich embeds into a chosen channel.

## üö¶ Feature tour

### Steam integration
- **Account linking (`/linksteam`)** ties a Discord user to a Steam ID (vanity URL, profile URL, or numeric ID) and locks the account to prevent duplicate claims. `/unlinksteam` clears cached data, marks, and locks for that member.
- **Achievement feed** polls each linked account‚Äôs recent games, compares unlock watermarks, and posts embeds with rarity call-outs and milestone summaries. The bot seeds watermarks on first run to prevent backfill spam and updates leaderboard stats as achievements roll in.
- **Library tracking** detects new purchases and removals (with a configurable grace period) so channels only see actionable changes. Updates feed into leaderboard stats for ‚Äúnew games added.‚Äù
- **Now playing + session recaps** waits for a configurable confirmation window before announcing a session start, tracks idle timeouts, and posts wrap-ups with total session length once the player leaves.
- **Steam leaderboards** maintain a single embed per guild showing lifetime playtime, two-week playtime, total achievements, and 30-day new games ‚Äì refreshed on a timer and recreated if moved.
- **Steam sales board** keeps a permanent embed with pagination buttons. Results are cached with warmers, TTL extension on hit, configurable sort order, and rate-limited navigation to avoid API abuse.

### Discord automation
- **Slash command suite** covers channel mapping, Steam account management, health checks, leaderboard/sales initialization, XP ranks, moderation (kick/ban/timeout/purge/clearchat/warn), and timed link permits. Commands check permissions before acting and provide audit reasons for moderation actions.
- **XP progression** awards 15‚Äì25 XP per eligible message with a cooldown, tracks total XP/levels in MySQL, and announces level-ups in the configured channel (`/rank` exposes stats).
- **Link enforcement** automatically deletes messages containing URLs unless the author is staff or has a current permit issued by `/permit`. Deleted users receive a DM explaining the policy.
- **Content moderation** normalizes message content, embeds, and attachment filenames before checking against a hate-speech list plus optional terms from `MODERATION_BANNED_TERMS`. Matching messages are deleted and the author is notified.
- **Logging hooks** capture joins, leaves, edits, deletions, role changes, and other guild events into the configured logging channel when `/setchannel type:logging` is used.

### GitHub integration
- **Poller** watches a configured repository/branch on an interval, caching the last announced SHA so only new commits become embeds. Rich embeds include author info, stats, and file summaries.
- **Webhook receiver** optionally exposes an HTTP endpoint that verifies payload signatures and pushes commits immediately alongside the poller (which remains as a safety net).
- **Standalone announcer script** (`github-announcer.js`) is provided for lightweight deployments that only need GitHub ‚Üí Discord mirroring without the full Paradise bot runtime.

## üîÅ Background jobs
- **Achievements loop:** polls recent games per linked member, announces unlocks, and records milestones & rarity summaries.
- **Owned games loop:** tracks library additions/removals, seeds on first run, and updates leaderboard statistics.
- **Now playing loop:** confirms sessions, watches for idle timeouts, and posts start/end embeds.
- **Leaderboard refresher:** ensures the embed exists in the mapped channel and rewrites it with aggregated stats on a schedule.
- **Sales crawler:** fetches specials, maintains multi-page caches, and updates the permanent sales embed & buttons.
- **GitHub announcer:** polls the configured repository for new commits and posts Discord embeds; optionally processes webhook pushes immediately.

All loops obey concurrency limits, seeding/backfill guards, and poll intervals defined in configuration to prevent first-run floods or API abuse.

---

## üß∞ Requirements
- Node.js 18+ (20 recommended).
- MySQL 8+ accessible from the bot runtime.
- Steam Web API key.
- Discord application with a bot token and permission to manage slash commands in your guild.

Optional: GitHub personal access token (for higher rate limits) and network access for webhook delivery if you enable the listener.

---

## üöÄ Setup
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Copy the environment template**
   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```
   Fill in Discord, Steam, database, and optional GitHub values. Every supported option is documented inline in `example.env`.
3. **Provision MySQL** (example)
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE paradise_bot CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
   GRANT ALL ON paradise_bot.* TO 'paradise'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'supersecret';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
   Update `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, and `DB_HOST` in `.env` to match.
4. **Run locally**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   Set `DEV_GUILD_ID` during development for instant slash command registration and keep `.env` loaded in the shell.
5. **Deploy** behind a supervisor (systemd, PM2, Docker, etc.) that restarts on crash and loads the same `.env` secrets. Expose the GitHub webhook port if you enable it.

## üóÑÔ∏è Persistence & schema
Tables are created or migrated automatically on startup (requires MySQL privileges for `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE`). Key tables include:
- `links`, `steam_account_locks` for Steam ‚Üî Discord associations.
- `watermarks`, `owned_seen`, `nowplaying_state`, `user_game_stats` for Steam tracking and leaderboard stats.
- `leaderboard_msgs`, `sales_msgs`, `github_announcements` for persistent embeds & commit state.
- `link_permits`, `xp_progress` for moderation utilities and XP progression.

Keep regular database backups ‚Äì the tables store long-term progress, cached Steam schemas, and bot configuration.

---

## üö¢ Deployment tips
- Run the bot with a supervisor that restarts on crash and captures stdout/stderr logs.
- Keep `.env` secrets out of source control; inject them via your process manager or secrets store.
- Monitor Steam API usage and adjust polling/concurrency if you hit rate limits.
- When enabling GitHub webhooks, ensure firewalls/proxies expose `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_PORT` and forward the configured path.
